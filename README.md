You can simply download .jar file [here](https://github.com/X00122527/College-Grant-System-with-GUI/tree/master/dist) and it should be ready to go.

Added folder with randomly created accounts called [grant_app](https://github.com/X00122527/College-Grant-System-with-GUI/tree/master/grant_app) - it should be located on desktop.
